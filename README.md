# BST
Binary Search Tree C++ (First repository practice)


For my first repository, I'll upload the code for my Binary Search Tree project from my PIC 10B programming class at UCLA


BinarySearchTree.h contains the declarations for the project
BinarySearchTreeImplementations.cpp contains the implementations of the classes and functions
main.cpp provides test code for the BST
